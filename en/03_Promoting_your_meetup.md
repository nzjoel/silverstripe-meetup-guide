#Promoting your meetup

Contact the SilverStripe community managers about every step youâ€™ll take, they'll happily work with you to ensure the best outcome for your event and support you. They have experience in organising meetups and can provide guidence (not unlike this guide book!).

Get your own Twitter and Facebook account, which will retweet and re-share everything SilverStripe is sharing about your meetup/conference. You can also use these to live microblog on the day.

During the meetup/conference, have it in your slides.

Aim for some well respected community members of technologists from the wider web commnity if you can. Having [exciting speakers](approaching_speakers) is something you can use to promote and get people along to your meetup.
